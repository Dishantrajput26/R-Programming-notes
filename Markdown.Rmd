## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
# Load the dplyr package (if not already loaded)
library(dplyr)

# Calculate the sum of mpg for each carburetor
aggr <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(carb) %>%
  summarise(summpg = sum(mpg))

# Print the aggregated data
print(aggr)

```

```{r}
View(mtcars)
```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots
```{r}
# Create the pie chart
pie(aggr$summpg, labels = aggr$carb, main = "Total MPG by Carburetor")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}
# Load the mtcars dataset (if not already loaded)
data(mtcars)

# Create a frequency table for the 'cyl' column
cyl_table <- table(mtcars$cyl)

```

```{r}
# Create the bar chart
barplot(cyl_table,
        xlab = "Number of Cylinders",
        ylab = "Frequency",
        main = "Bar Chart: Number of Cylinders in mtcars",
        col = "skyblue")

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
